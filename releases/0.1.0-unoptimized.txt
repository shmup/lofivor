the baseline: one draw call per entity, pure and simple

- individual rl.drawCircle() calls in a loop
- ~5k entities at 60fps before frame times tank
- linear scaling: 10k = ~43ms, 20k = ~77ms
- render-bound (update loop stays under 1ms even at 30k)
- each circle is its own GPU draw call
- the starting point for optimization experiments
